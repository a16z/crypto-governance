Terminate.ByTokenholder.ForCause.sec={_Tokenholder} may only terminate this {_Agreement} prior to the expiration of the {_Term} in the event that {_Delegate} materially fails to satisfy its {_Protocol} governance duties described in Section {Participate.Xnum} herein, including, without limitation, continued non-participation in material votes, and does not cure such breach within {Term.Termination.TokenholderForCause.Notice.Days.#} days.
