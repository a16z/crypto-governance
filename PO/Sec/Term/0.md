Terminate.ByTokenholder.ForCause.sec={_Tokenholder} may only terminate this {_Agreement} prior to the expiration of the {_Term} in the event that {_Delegate} materially fails to satisfy its {_Protocol} governance duties described in Section {Participate.Xnum} herein, including, without limitation, continued non-participation in material votes, and does not cure such breach within {Term.Termination.TokenholderForCause.Notice.Days.#} days.

In such case, {_Delegate} shall provide any assistance reasonably requested by {_Tokenholder} for the purpose of revoking and returning the {_Delegated_Portion} and terminating this {_Agreement}.
